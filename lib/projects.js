        This is a repository containing slides and example code for a talk I gave at
        Gem City JS in January of 2019 on common Data Visualization workflows for
        the web. I gave examples using React, Angular, and Vue, along with other
        common Data Visualization tools such as Tableau and Adobe Illustrator / Affinity Designer.
        It may be confusing if you didn't see the talk, but basically, it consisted of
        me going through the slides for each of the sections and then showing the running
        demo and walking through the code.

        I founded and led the Dayton Data Visualization meetup from 2014 until 2018. Running a meetup
        was a great experience where I learned a ton about Data Visualization and made lots of
        new friends. Also, it was a lot of setting up chairs, coordinating food deliveries, and
        finding people to volunteer their free time to come and speak at my event. It was fun,
        but is currently on hiatus.
