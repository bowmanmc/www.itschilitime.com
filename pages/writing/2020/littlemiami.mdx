Ohio is home to the nation's largest network of paved bike trails, with over 350 miles in the
[Miami Valley Region](https://www.miamivalleytrails.org).
We've been hitting them a lot this year, and this past weekend, my son Samuel and I set off for
an afternoon ride on the [Little Miami Scenic Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Miami_Scenic_Trail).
Specifically, we decided to ride the section between Xenia and Yellow Springs,
a beautiful bit of the trail that goes through some wide open farmland as well as through
some wooded sections along the [Little Miami River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Miami_River).

I've been trying to take my camera along with me on these sorts of adventures lately,
and even though I don't always use it, I've never regretted having it with me just in case.
Despite being at the front-end of the season here in Ohio, I was hoping to catch some fall time colors.

About three quarters of the way to Yellow Springs, right before you ride past the
[Glen Helen Nature Preserve](https://www.glenhelen.org),
is the [Hyde Road Covered Bridge](http://bridgehunter.com/oh/greene/bh70221/)
which goes over the bike trail.
I was thinking this would be a great place to get some pictures with Samuel.
It turns out that going from Xenia to Yellow Springs is almost entirely at a
slight incline, so by the time we made it to the covered bridge, we were pretty well sacked out.
We snapped some photos around the bridge and had a snack, then turned around to come home.

On the way back we stopped to take a quick snap of this bridge crossing the Little Miami River.
The bike path was busy and we had to wait awhile to try and get a shot without anyone in
frame (you can still just make out two riders in the distance). Samuel looked out for riders coming up
from behind, while I sat down in the middle of the path and Grabbed this shot from near the ground.
The trees were just starting to turn yellow and the path was getting a good dusting with the first
wave of leaves to fall.
