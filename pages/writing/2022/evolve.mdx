Confession time, I‚Äôve always wanted to be an artist. But when I was younger,
there were a lot of other kids in school who were ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than me. They had
more natural talent and were encouraged to keep drawing and making more art by
the adults (while I was encouraged to go back to licking glue sticks and being
quiet). Now that I‚Äôm older, and I‚Äôve realized that ‚Äútalent‚Äù matters so much
less than effort and practice, I decided to get back into it and try to learn
how to paint.

Kevin Murphy, the artist behind
[Evolve](https://evolveartist.com), has over the years developed a fool-proof program that can
teach anyone to paint (and paint well). I was super impressed by the portraits shown on the
website, and surprised to hear that most of them were painted by high school
students with only a few months of instruction. I was sold and am so happy that
I decided to join! It‚Äôs been a great experience over the last year learning how
to paint and I‚Äôm very proud and excited about how far I‚Äôve come.
Below are some details about the program and my journey thus far.

The main course you buy access to consists of four ‚Äúblocks‚Äù.
Each block consists of twenty assignments. For each assignment,
you watch the instructional videos and then complete the painting. You then
upload a picture of your painting, along with pictures of your reference and
under-drawings to a website where Evolve instructors take a look give you
feedback on it within twenty four hours. The instructors are all very engaging and
always gave critical feedback that helped me in the following paintings, along
with words of encouragement.

In one of the first videos, Kevin says that all paintings can be broken down
into three things: Edge, Value, and Color. Blocks 1 and 2 build up your
expertise controlling edge and value, leaving blocks 3 and 4 to add color
into the mix.

You literally start by painting squares on a canvas. The course assumes no
prior art education or experience and builds you up by teaching fundamentals
and then building on those gradually over the block. Each painting is a bit
harder than the one before it and you learn a new skill or enhance your
understanding of one you‚Äôve already learned by practicing it.

Block 2 is focused on proportional drawing, and instead of tracing a provided under-drawing,
you setup a still life on your own and draw it yourself. For me, this was the hardest to
learn. What helped me was realizing that what they‚Äôre teaching you in the
course isn‚Äôt actually a way to draw, but rather a way to check your drawings and square
them against what you‚Äôre seeing with your eyes. I think the only way to get
better at drawing is to just practice, but now I have a way to check my work
and feel that with enough time and a big enough eraser I can draw anything üéâ

Timelines are weird and you move through the course at your own pace, so it‚Äôs
hard to say how long all this should take. Between my day job and my night job
teaching at Sinclair, I usually only paint on the weekends. Most of the
paintings took 2-4 hours to complete, but towards the end of block 2 I would
spend 2-4 hours doing the drawing and then 4-6 hours painting. The final
painting of the skull took me the longest. I spent two weekends drawing it
and then another two weekends painting it. That one was a big stretch for me
though and wasn‚Äôt typical. I‚Äôm now halfway through the course and it took me
almost exactly a year.

I‚Äôm looking forward to diving into color paintings and completing the course!
My goal is to be able to paint portraits. When I started, that seemed like a
very lofty, unobtainable goal, but now I can see a path there and can‚Äôt wait
to do it! If you‚Äôre interested in painting too, know that you
absolutely can and in my opinion, [Evolve](https://evolveartist.com) is the
way to go. You can also look for one of their in-person schools across the
country that teach the same curriculum at
[The Art Academy]([https://artacademystudios.com](https://artacademystudios.com/)).
One of the students has been documenting her journey on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Mithrilda)
and it has been super helpful for me to watch along and see how she approached
paintings I've been doing too.
