        This is a repository containing slides and example code for a talk I gave at
        Gem City JS in January of 2019 on common Data Visualization workflows for
        the web. I gave examples using React, Angular, and Vue, along with other
        common Data Visualization tools such as Tableau and Adobe Illustrator / Affinity Designer.
        It may be confusing if you didn't see the talk, but basically, it consisted of
        me going through the slides for each of the sections and then showing the running
        demo and walking through the code.
